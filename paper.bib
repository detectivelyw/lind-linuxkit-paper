abstract = "This paper presents a study on the practicality of operating system (OS) kernel debloating-reducing kernel code that is not needed by the target applications-in real-world systems. Despite their significant benefits regarding security (attack surface reduction) and performance (fast boot times and reduced memory footprints), the state-of-the-art OS kernel debloating techniques are seldom adopted in practice, especially in production systems. We identify the limitations of existing kernel debloating techniques that hinder their practical adoption, including both accidental and essential limitations. To understand these limitations, we build an advanced debloating framework named Cozart which enables us to conduct a number of experiments on different types of OS kernels (including Linux and the L4 microkernel) with a wide variety of applications (including HTTPD, Memcached, MySQL, NGINX, PHP and Redis). Our experimental results reveal the challenges and opportunities towards making kernel debloating techniques practical for realworld systems. The main goal of this paper is to share these insights and our experiences to shed light on addressing the limitations of kernel debloating in future research and development efforts. ",

As stricter memory isolation mechanisms between the kernel and user space become commonplace, attackers increasingly rely on code reuse techniques to exploit kernel vulnerabilities. Contrary to similar attacks in more restrictive settings, as in web browsers, in kernel exploitation, non-privileged local adversaries have great flexibility in abusing memory disclosure vulnerabilities to dynamically discover, or infer, the location of code snippets in order to construct code-reuse payloads. Recent studies have shown that the coupling of code diversification with the enforcement of a “read XOR execute” (R∧X) memory safety policy is an effective defense against the exploitation of userland software, but so far this approach has not been applied for the protection of the kernel itself.In this article, we fill this gap by presenting kR∧X: a kernel-hardening scheme based on execute-only memory and code diversification. We study a previously unexplored point in the design space, where a hypervisor or a super-privileged component is not required. Implemented mostly as a set of GCC plugins, kR∧X is readily applicable to x86 Linux kernels (both 32b and 64b) and can benefit from hardware support (segmentation on x86, MPX on x86-64) to optimize performance. In full protection mode, kR∧X incurs a low runtime overhead of 4.04\%, which drops to 2.32\% when MPX is available, and 1.32\% when memory segmentation is in use.}, journal = {ACM Trans. Priv.

TZ-RKP is more secure than current approaches that use hypervisors to host kernel protection tools. Although hypervisors provide privilege and isolation, they face fundamental security challenges due to their growing complexity and code size. TZ-RKP puts its security monitor, which represents its entire Trusted Computing Base (TCB), in the TrustZone secure world; a safe isolated environment that is dedicated to security services. Hence, the security monitor is safe from attacks that can potentially compromise the kernel, which runs in the normal world. Using the secure world for kernel protection has been crippled by the lack of control over targets that run in the normal world. TZ-RKP solves this prominent challenge using novel techniques that deprive the normal world from the ability to control certain privileged system functions. These functions are forced to route through the secure world for inspection and approval before being executed. TZ-RKP's control of the normal world is non-bypassable. It can effectively stop attacks that aim at modifying or injecting kernel binaries. It can also stop attacks that involve modifying the system memory layout, e.g, through memory double mapping. This paper presents the implementation and evaluation of TZ-RKP, which has gone through rigorous and thorough evaluation of effectiveness and performance. It is currently deployed on the latest models of the Samsung Galaxy series smart phones and tablets, which clearly demonstrates that it is a practical real-world system.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security}, pages = {90–102}, numpages = {13}, keywords = {integrity monitoring, arm trustzone, kernel protection}, location = {Scottsdale, Arizona, USA}, series = {CCS '14} }

Ever-growing code size in those projects, due to the addition of new features and the reluctance to remove legacy support, indicate that this problem will remain a severe system security threat in the foreseeable future. Reactive measures such as bug fixes via code reviews and testing, while effective, can only alleviate the issue. Furthermore, common practices in system hardening often focus on complex and sometimes hard to achieve goals that require extensive manual intervention such as security policies for sandboxing.In this paper, we explore an alternative, automated and effective way of reducing the attack surface in commodity operating system kernels, which we call trimming. Trimming is a two-fold process: an initial analysis of a given system for unused kernel code sections is followed by an enforcement phase, in which the unused sections are removed or prevented from being executed. We discuss the requirements that should be reflected in the design of a trimming infrastructure, and present a lightweight and flexible implementation example for the Linux kernel by using dynamic binary instrumentation as provided by kprobes. Our evaluations show we can, in the case of a web server, reduce the attack surface of the kernel (in terms of the number of kernel functions accessible from unprivileged users) by about 88\%.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the Fourth European Workshop on System Security}, articleno = {6}, numpages = {6}, keywords = {kernel hardening, attack surface reduction}, location = {Salzburg, Austria}, series = {EUROSEC '11} }

On the downside, containers offer weaker isolation than VMs, to the point where people run containers in virtual machines to achieve proper isolation. In this paper, we examine whether there is indeed a strict tradeoff between isolation (VMs) and efficiency (containers). We find that VMs can be as nimble as containers, as long as they are small and the toolstack is fast enough.We achieve lightweight VMs by using unikernels for specialized applications and with Tinyx, a tool that enables creating tailor-made, trimmed-down Linux virtual machines. By themselves, lightweight virtual machines are not enough to ensure good performance since the virtualization control plane (the toolstack) becomes the performance bottleneck. We present LightVM, a new virtualization solution based on Xen that is optimized to offer fast boot-times regardless of the number of active VMs. LightVM features a complete redesign of Xen's control plane, transforming its centralized operation to a distributed one where interactions with the hypervisor are reduced to a minimum. LightVM can boot a VM in 2.3ms, comparable to fork/exec on Linux (1ms), and two orders of magnitude faster than Docker. LightVM can pack thousands of LightVM guests on modest hardware with memory and CPU usage comparable to that of processes.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 26th Symposium on Operating Systems Principles}, pages = {218–233}, numpages = {16}, keywords = {hypervisor, operating systems, Virtualization, containers, Xen, virtual machine, specialization, unikernels}, location = {Shanghai, China}, series = {SOSP '17} }
