\section{Limitations}
\label{sec.limitation}
While our results and analysis indicate that our dataset was representative of the common workload users performed when using container applications, 
we believe that a larger sample base with more runs could potentially capture the race-condition related kernel footprint more comprehensively, thus rendering more accurate popular paths data. 

Another factor that could have affected our work was the type of images we used. 
We limited our selection to official container images from Docker Hub, while there are a number of popular Docker images from open source projects on Github that we did not access. 
With our methodology used in this work, running these additional containers to obtain and analyze their popular paths might have given us a broader spectrum of results.

Lastly, in this work, we ran our system and produced results with Linux kernel version 4.14.24. 
For future work, we plan to extend our system so that it can automatically work with different kernel versions. 
This will generalize the use of our work, and potentially help a lot more users to secure their containers.
