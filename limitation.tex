\section{Limitations}
\label{sec.limitation}
While our results and analysis indicate that our dataset was representative of the workload users perform when using container applications, 
the sample size was somewhat limited and therefore, so was the data. 
Additional runs and a larger sample base could potentially capture the race-condition related kernel footprint more comprehensively, thus rendering more accurate popular paths data. 

Another factor that could have affected our work was the type of images we used. 
We limited our selection to official container images from Docker Hub, yet there are a number of open source project images we did not access. 
The methodology used in this work run in these additional containers might have given us a broader spectrum of results.

Lastly, in this work, we ran our system and produced results with Linux kernel version 4.14.24. 
For future work, we plan to extend our system so that it can automatically work with different kernel versions. 
This will generalize the application of our work, and potentially help a lot more users to secure their containers.
